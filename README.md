### New Stuff
- learned that you can change properties for a const object, just not reassign it
- learned how to use outerHTML based on returned element constructed in js, and from copying outerHTML in browser inspect tools
- first time using js to append elements to each other and then appending to a container in the dom

```js
```

---
### Challenges Encountered
- had a hard time differentiating between using margin and padding and when
- didn't realize that I had to use outerHTML after the element was returned from my function to cast the element into a string

---
### Next Steps and Follow Up Questions
- would want to check out creating two different viewing modes for whole site
- curious if it would be possible to list matching items listed on ebay or other sellers
- think it would be fun to embed a soundtrack kind of like a myspace page
